               <h1>San Francisco</h1>
               <p>I have traveled to this city <b>MANY</b>times. The city by the bay never disappoints - from the beautiful golden gate bridge, delicious bowl of clam chowder at
               Fisherman's wharf, to a great ride on a famous cable car. When traveling here, make sure to pack clothes for all types of weather; you can be sweating in January and freezing
               in July - as Mark Twain famously said "The coldest winter I ever saw was the summer I spent in San Francisco." </p>

               <h1>New York City</h1>
               <p>"The City that Never Sleeps" was a nickname coined by Frank Sinatra about New York. SO true - the hustle and bustle and constant go go of this city makes for
                   an exciting trip.  When you are here, visit the Statue of Liberty, ride to the top of the Empire State Building, Rockfeller Center is always fun, and never 
                   leave without seeing a Broadway show.  We also walked across the Brookly Bridge and had a slice from the famous pizzera, Grimaldi's in DUMBO. Also, attending
                    a game in Yankee Stadium was another highlight of our trip. </p>

               <h1>Pittsburgh</h1>
               <p>Pittsburgh?!!  The Steel City or our nickname, <b>FOOTBALL HEAVEN</b>!It's true, our favorite thing to do in the 'burgh is to attend a football game at Heinz Field. 
               We also love driving by the boyhood home of my husband, John and grabbing a delicious AUTHENTIC bagel from a bagel shop in Squirrel Hill. ( Saint Louis does not know 
               what a bagel is!) Also a stop at Primanti Brothers for a famous cheesesteak sub.  Less you think we only eat in Pittsburgh, a visit to Kennywood Theme Park, touring the 
               Andy Warhol museum, or drive out to see Frank Lloyd Wright's famous Falling Waters are some activities to add to the agenda.</p>
